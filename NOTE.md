**A note on object-oriented design**:  since each line of the data file represents one day's worth of measurements, and each day has the same set of properties, it would be natural to write a class with fields to hold all these values for a single day.  Your program could then read the file a line at a time, produce an instance of this class from each line, and put them all in an array.  We're deliberately not doing that here, partly to avoid the trouble of handling all those extra fields we won't be using, and partly to put the focus on the use of multiple arrays.  So instead of a single array where each element holds an object with all of a day's values, we're using multiple individual arrays storing the values of one particular measurement over all the days.  The values from a particular day that would have been part of a single object are instead distributed over the multiple arrays, each at the same index location.

**A note on lo and hi**: You can assume that the values given for `lo` and `hi` are valid. If they are not, then Java will by default throw an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, which is an appropriate response to the situation.
